### This repository contains the solution for six tasks in java, covering loops, arrays and others

**Task1: Even or Odd**

A program that takes an integer input from the user.
using conditionals I check if the number is even or odd and print the result.

**Task2: Guessing Game**

A program that generates a random number between 1 and 100.
Then ask the user to guess the number and give them hints like "too high" or "too low."
It also keep track of the number of attempts the user makes.

**Task3: Sum of Digits**

A program that asks the user to input an integer.
It uses a loop to calculate the sum of its digits and print the result.

**Task4: Fibonacci Sequence**

A program that asks the user for an integer n.
Then uses a loop to print the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

**Task5: Prime Number Checker**

A program that takes an integer as input.
Then uses a loop and conditionals to determine whether the number is prime or not.

**Task6: Number Reversal**

A program that takes an integer from the user and reverses the digits.
Then it print the reversed number.
